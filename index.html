                <h1>Jason Lu</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Jason Lu and I am pursuing my PhD in Civil Engineering and M.S. in Industrial and Operations Engineering at the <a href="https://umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/masoud-neda/">Prof. Neda Masoud</a> in the <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nmasoud/index.html">Next Generation Mobility Systems Lab</a>. My personal research interest lies in optimization and machine learning to innovate transportation systems. Specifically, my motivation is to design more intelligent and operationally efficient mobility, transit, and freight systems. I am also the Vice President of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/misto">Michigan Transportation Student Organization</a>.</p>
                <p>I obtained my B.S. in Industrial Engineering with a Minor in Scientific and Engineering Computing at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>, where I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant, and after graduation a Research Assistant, in the <a href="https://sam.isye.gatech.edu">Socially Aware Mobility Lab</a> and the <a href="https://www.ai4opt.org">Artificial Intelligence Institute for Advances in Optimization</a> under <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/pascal-van-hentenryck">Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck</a>.</p>
                <p>While at Georgia Tech, I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant and Head Teaching Assistant for four different courses. I was also the instructor of the <a href="https://sethbondercamp.isye.gatech.edu">The Seth Bonder Camp in Computational and Data Science for Engineering</a>, a high school STEM outreach initiative.</p>

                <p>I worked as an Industrial Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.yokogawa.com/us/">Yokogawa</a> Summer 2020, Summer 2021, and Fall 2021 in the Manufacturing and Quality Engineering Department. During the Spring of 2022, my senior design team partnered with <a href="https://convoy.com">Convoy</a> in their Process Design and Improvement Department as Process Improvement Interns, where my team was 1 of 3 finalists for the semester!</p>
                <p>In my free time (during the few occasions when I have some), you can find me eating Korean BBQ, attending music festivals, going to the movies, or watching <a href="https://www.nascar.com">NASCAR</a>.<br><br>
