            <h1>Jason Lu</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jason Lu and I am from Dallas, Texas. I am an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering with a Concentration in Analytics and Data Science and a Minor in Scientific and Engineering Computing.</p>
            <p>I currently serve as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the <a href="https://sam.isye.gatech.edu">Socially Aware Mobility Lab</a> under <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/pascal-van-hentenryck">Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck</a>, where my focus is on improving On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems.</p>
            <p>My personal research interest lies in computational optimization and machine learning to innovate transportation systems. Specifically, my motivation is to design more intelligent and operationally efficient mobility, transit, and freight systems that could be applied to smart cities. I also have a side interest in working with energy systems for smart cities. I'm applying to PhD programs for Fall 2023.</p>
            <p>During my undergrad, I worked as an Industrial Engineering Co-op at <a href="https://www.yokogawa.com/us/">Yokogawa</a> Summer 2020, Summer 2021, and Fall 2021 in the Manufacturing and Quality Engineering Department. During the Spring of 2022, my senior design team partnered with <a href="https://convoy.com">Convoy</a> and their customer experience department as process improvement interns.</p>
            <p>Outside of research and classes at Georgia Tech, I've been involved with teaching assistantships, K-12 STEM outreach, pro-bono consulting, and greek life.</p>
            <p>In my free time (during the few occasions where I have some), you can find me eating Korean BBQ, building my farm in <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net">Stardew Valley</a>, or watching <a href="https://www.nascar.com">NASCAR</a>.<br><br>
