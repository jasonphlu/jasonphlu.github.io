            <h1><u>Research Statement</u></h1>
            <p>Over the past three years, I have delved into studies on industrial and systems engineering and became fascinated by the possibilities of optimization, simulation, and operations research in today's society. But that was not enough for me. To innovate the future, I had to combine this with computational methods to truly solve problems on a large scale basis. </p>

            <h1>Research Interest</h1>
            <p>Optimization and machine learning to innovate transportation systems with the goal to make more intelligent and operationally efficient mobility, transit, and freight systems.</p>
            
            <h1>Undergraduate Research Experience</h1>
            <p>I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the <a href="https://sam.isye.gatech.edu">Socially Aware Mobility Lab</a> under <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/pascal-van-hentenryck">Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck</a>. The core focus of the lab is on <a href="https://sam.isye.gatech.edu/projects/demand-multimodal-transit-systems">On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems</a>: a transit system made up of fixed bus and rail networks with shuttles routed dynamically based on transit demand. ODMTS innovates transit by solving the first/last mile problem and providing convenience to riders. This <a href="https://sam.isye.gatech.edu/projects/demand-multimodal-transit-systems">video</a> goes into ODMTS in more detail! I work on a series of projects contributing to ODMTS.</p>

            <h2><b>Jason Lu</b>, Anthony Trasatti, Hongzhao Guan, Kevin Dalmeijer, Pascal Van Hentenryck, "Impacts of Dedicated Bus Lanes and Congestion on On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems"</h2>
            <p>This project was the first project I lead from beginning to end, culminating with my first lead-author paper.</p>

            <h1>Ongoing Projects</h1>
            <h2><u>Optimization of Network Design in ODMTS</u></h2>
            <p>The optimization of network design for ODMTS is always advancing. In this project, the network design advances by adding a formulation to model bus lines in the system in order to more accurately represent wait times in transit. I contributed to this project by implementing methods to account for objective costs among riders through different bus lines. I also created data for the case study and ran some initial experiments on the path evaluation implementations for riders.</p>

            <h2><u>MARTA Reach</u></h2>
            <p>Marta Reach was a six-month pilot of the ODMTS applied to MARTA. You can take a closer look at the MARTA Reach Pilot <a href="https://sam.isye.gatech.edu/projects/demand-multimodal-transit-systems/atlanta-pilot">here</a>!</p>
            <p>In the Pilot project, I am investigating the effects of shuttle fleet sizing and autonomous vehicles in the Pilot.</p>

            <h2><u>Demand Mode Choice Modeling in ODMTS</u></h2>
            <p>The goal for this project is to find a better way to model adoption and mode choice among transit riders in ODMTS. I'm studying mode choice modeling and multinominal logistic regression.</p>
